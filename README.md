### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are the languages I usually program in. As you can see, I'm mostly using Python (3), and other scripting languages, but I'm also fine with PHP and more.

I found some pretty nice README.md on there, so I might one day get inspired to make mine cool too! 

Any of my repositories are fair game to make pull-requests in. You can see below a list of nice projetcs I contribute too. Join me in the adventure in october, and you might as well get a free T-Shirt. Good luck !
